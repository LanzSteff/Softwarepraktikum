Hi,

Unfortunately I won't be able to meet you all tomorrow at 4pm. Let us 
meet next week, either Tue, 22.11 at 9:30 am (preferable) or sometime on 
Thursday 24.11.
In the meantime, if you have urgent questions you can drop by my office 
tomorrow morning between 9-11, or you can send them to me by e-mail. 
Also, please download my private copy of the EMF book from

http://cs.uni-salzburg.at/~stefan.resmerita/9780321544292.pdf

Let me know as soon as you've downloaded it, so I can remove the link.
Also, let me know when you can come next week.

Regards,
  Stefan Resmerita
